# Encrypt/Decrypt

A simple script that allows you to encrypt or decrypt any file.

## Usage

To use the Python script:

First, install cryptography:
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

Then you can run the script via:
```bash
python Encrypt-Decrypt.pyw encrypt example.file
python Encrypt-Decrypt.pyw decrypt example.file
```

And to use the exe:

```bash
Encrypt-Decrypt.exe encrypt example.file
Encrypt-Decrypt.exe decrypt example.file
```

You can double click any to open the GUI version.

**Note**: your secret.key must be in the same folder as your encrypted_example.file because it is needed to decrypt the file.
